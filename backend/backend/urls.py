- **User Registration & Authentication**:
  - User registration endpoint.
  - API endpoints for obtaining and refreshing JWT tokens.
  - API authentication endpoints for login/logout using Django REST Framework.
- **Appointments API**:
  - General appointment management (CRUD operations).
  - Doctor-specific and lab technician-specific appointment handling.
